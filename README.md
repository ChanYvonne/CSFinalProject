# CSFinalDemo
This is a basic one-level platformer game, very similar to the game Thomas Was Alone.  There are two characters to control, who must each get to their respective rectangles at the end to finish the level.  You control the characters using the direction arrow keys on your keyboard.  The spacebar allows the characters to jump.  Pressing "Q" allows the user to switch between characters.
